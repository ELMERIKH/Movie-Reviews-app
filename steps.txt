Create a Node.js server using Express.js to handle API routes and connect to the MongoDB database.

Build the front-end using React.js, including pages for movie listings, individual movie pages, user authentication and registration, and commenting on movies.

Implement user authentication and registration using JSON web tokens (JWT) and bcrypt.

Create an API to handle CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for movies, reviews, and users.

Connect the front-end and back-end by making API calls to the server from the React components.

Deploy the application to a hosting platform like Heroku or AWS.
